# Definiton #
The If ... Then statement is one of the most basic _control flow_ statement in computer science.
It tells your program to execute a certain section of code
_only if_ a _**test**_  or _**condition**_ evaluates to `True`.

The logic the computer follows is much the same as in plain English.

> If there is an elephant in the refrigerator, then I'll give you 100 dollars.

The _**test**_ in this case is `there is an elephant in the refrigerator`.
As ridiculous as this sounds, it can _only_ evaluate to one of 2 values:
  1. **True** - there actually _is_ an elephant in the refrigerator
  1. **False** - the refrigerator is a pachyderm-free zone.


And you can read a Visual Basic example almost like an sentence too:
```
  If ThereIsAnElephantInTheRefrigerator = True Then
       You = You + 100  ' dollars   '
  End If
```
and generally:
```
  If expression Then
       ' zero or more statements here'
  End If
```


Just as in the plain English case, the _**condition**_ is either `True` or `False`.
  1. **True** - The code block between `Then` and `End If` is evaluated.
  1. **False** - The code block is skipped.
