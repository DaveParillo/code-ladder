# What is a Compiler? #

A compiler is a computer program that transforms text written in a programming language into something else.  Frequently, that 'something else' is a binary file known as object code.

The original program text the compiler reads is known as **source code** as it is the _source_ of input to the compiler.  Source code is easy for people to read, but difficult for a machine.

**Object code** is the output of the compiler - with the source code instruction now in a format that can be read and executed by the computer. Object code is easy for machines to read, but difficult for people.
