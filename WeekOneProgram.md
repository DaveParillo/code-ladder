# What is a Program? #

Computers simply follow instructions.  Nothing more and nothing less.  A computer can only understand instructions presented in it's own language: “machine language”.  Machine language is specific to the CPU hardware and operating system and is composed of a (largely) unintelligible stream of 1’s and 0’s.

This is why programs built for Windows do not run on a Mac OS X computer and vice versa.

Since humans find it difficult to write programs using only 1's and 0's, they have invented many other computer languages which are easier to read and write.

_Computer programmers_ use these _higher level languages_ to describe the processing the computer needs to perform.  These instructions are statements, written in plain text which eventually become a computer program.

The instructions define one or more algorithms which describe a complete task.  Another way of thinking of it is that the instructions are a form of recipe or directions which the computer can follow.

Computer programmers use _**tools**_ to transform _**text**_ into a form the machine can _**execute**_

## Parts of a program ##

  * Statement
    * A single programming 'sentence'.  More about statements [here](#Statements.md)

  * Functions and Subroutines
    * Groups of statements working together performing a single task

  * Classes and Modules
    * Groups of functions and subroutines
    * Typically grouped together supporting a related set of algorithms

Taken together these parts are _**assembled**_ using special tools to create the machine code a computer can execute.


## Statements ##

All computer languages are comprised of statements.  Statements are themselves built up from the following parts:
  * Keywords (Reserved Words)
    * Words with special meaning  that make up a high-level programming language, cannot be used for any other purpose
  * Operators
    * Special symbols that perform various operations on data
  * Variables
    * Used to store data in memory, named by the programmer
  * Syntax
    * Rules governing keywords, operators and variables
    * If even a single syntax error appears in a program, it will not compile or execute!
