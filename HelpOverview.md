**Code Ladder** provides an opportunity to practice Visual Basic or C# programming.
**Code Ladder** will present a series of problems of slowly increasing difficulty.
That's the ladder part.

The solution to each problem is a short bit of actual code.  That's the code part.
You will actually be writing real code right away.
**Code Ladder** [compiles](WhatIsCompiler.md) it, provides feedback on what you wrote, and displays the results of your code.
If you solve the problem correctly, the 1 point is added to your score and you may continue.

Actually, you can skip to the next problem even if you **don't** answer a question, but since problems tend to get harder as you progress through the ladder, this may create more problems than it solves.
