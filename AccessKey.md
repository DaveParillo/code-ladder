# Definiton #

Visual Basic Forms have two properties which allow you to bind the keyboard _Enter_ and _Escape_ keys to two different button controls on the form.

## Accept ##
The _Accept_ property binds a button on the form to the _Enter_ key.

When the _Enter_ key is pressed, it is as if the user had clicked on the button defined in the _Accept_ property.

## Cancel ##
The _Cancel_ property binds a button on the form to the _Escape_ key.

When the _Escape_ key is pressed, it is as if the user had clicked on the button defined in the _Cancel_ property.
