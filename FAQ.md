# How do I save my work? #

You don't have to do anything special.
Each time you solve a problem correctly, your progress is automatically saved to a file.

Each week's work is saved is a different file name.
The file is automatically saved in the same folder containing the CodeLadder.exe program.
The file name is of the form `Week_NSavedGame.dat`, where _N_ is the week number you are working on.

For the paranoid, there is a **Save** button available under the **File** menu item which will force a save, even if you have made no progress.

# How do I hand in my homework? #

Upload the saved .dat file to the appropriate Blackboard assignment.
The file name is of the form `Week_NSavedGame.dat`, where _N_ is the week number you are working on.

Do **NOT** upload the `CodeLadder.exe`.
Your homework is saved in the data file.  It's not in the executable program.
Uploading the exe file is one of the most common mistakes people make when handing in homework.
