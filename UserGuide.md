# The Fundamentals #
When you start CodeLadder, it should look something like the following annotated image below.

![http://wiki.code-ladder.googlecode.com/git/images/codeLadder.png](http://wiki.code-ladder.googlecode.com/git/images/codeLadder.png)

Each of the numbered portions of the image are explained in the sections which follow.

Each time you open code ladder, it picks up from the highest level problem set in the folder containing the CodeLadder program.

The Menu Bar across the top contains the bare minimum of what one might expect:
  * **File**
    * **New**: Deletes all progress and data from the current week and restarts
    * **Save**: Forces a save.  Saved files are always stored in the same folder containing the CodeLadder program.
> > > You don't ever actually need to manually save.  CodeLadder will automatically save your progress each time you answer a question correctly.  This menu item is mainly for those who don't trust software.
    * **Exit**: Close the application.
  * **Edit**
    * **Preferences**: Opens a dialog window allowing you to enter your name, which will appear in the CodeLadder title bar.
> > > It also is where you go to Open the Week 2 set of problems after you have completed Week 1.


> There are no _Copy_ or _Paste_ menu items.  You need to use a KeyboardShortcut if you want to perform those kinds of editing operations.
  * **View**
    * **History**: Opens a dialog displaying all the activities you performed within code ladder.  Your instructor uses this to identify question that are particularly troublesome, or perhaps just poorly worded.
  * **Help**
    * **Open Help**: Open a web browser tot he 'Introduction' page of this wiki.
    * "About**: Opens a dialog that displays some information about this program.**


## 1 Navigation Controls ##
Intended to feel similar to media player controls,
these 5 buttons allow you to both move between questions easily.
The **Evaluate!** button, which occupies the space that would ordinarily be 'Play' actually compiles the code you write and displays the results.

Going from left to right, the buttons perform the following functions:
  * Jump to the first problem in the set.
  * Go back to the previous problem in the set
  * Compile and run your code.  This also saves your progress.
  * Go to the next problem in the set
  * Jump to the last problem in the set.


## 2 Font Controls ##
Allows you to make text in the program larger or smaller.
The larger looking 'A' makes text bigger, the other makes text smaller.


## 3 Score and Progress ##
Displays the number of correct answers and the total number of questions in the current set.

Each time you answer a question correctly, the score increments by 1.

No credit for answering the same question twice, sorry.


## 4 Current Problem Description ##
This represents the main body of CodeLadder.

At the top is a problem description.
It describes a problem whose solution is a small piece of actual code.

You type your solution in the middle Text Box.
Often you will be provided with some code to start with.

After typing your code, you press the **Evaluate!** button to see the results.

Results are displayed in the bottom section.

Some questions may contain a link to question specific help.  If it exists, you can click it to launch a new browser window which will display information that might help you if you are stuck.


## 5 My Code Bin ##
Each time you answer a question correctly, the code from the Your Code area is appended to the Code Bin.

This happens no matter how many times you answer a question correctly.

By answering questions you are building up your own library of working examples in you can use elsewhere.

The Code Bin can be a useful resource when working on your projects and I recommend that you take advantage of it.
