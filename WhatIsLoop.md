# What is a Loop? #
A _**loop**_ causes one or more statements to repeat.

Each repetition of the loop is called an _**iteration**_.
Visual Basic has two types of loops:
  1. The ['Do' Loop](DoLoop.md)
    * The DoLoop comes in two basic variations: 'While' and 'Until'
  1. The ['For' Loop](ForLoop.md)
    * The ForLoop also has variations: 'For ... Next' and 'For Each'

The difference among them is how they control the repetition.
